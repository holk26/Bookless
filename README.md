# Bookless

**Headless scheduling infrastructure for modern applications.**

Bookless is an API-first, open-core scheduling service designed to be embedded into any application as a modular component. It provides availability management and booking logic through clean, versioned APIs without imposing UI, user models, or shared databases.

---

## ✨ What is Bookless?

Bookless helps teams add scheduling and booking capabilities to their products without rebuilding the same logic over and over again.

It is built as infrastructure, not as an end-user application, making it suitable for SaaS platforms, internal tools, CRMs, and custom software that require full control over UX and data ownership.

## 🔑 Key Characteristics

- API-first design
- Fully decoupled and modular
- Multi-tenant by default

## 🔌 How It Integrates

Bookless integrates with client applications through:
